### Manual Q-Learning
By manually guiding the agent along the optimal path in Gridworld for four episodes, we allow the Q-learning algorithm to update its Q-values and begin learning the correct policy through direct experience.

### Q-Learning (Small vs Medium Grid)
On the small grid, Pacman reliably wins after training due to a limited state space, while on the medium grid, inconsistent performance highlights Q-learning's inability to generalize across larger, more complex environments.

### Approximate Q-Learning Agent (10 games)
By generalizing across similar states using feature-based learning, Pacman is able to consistently win all games on the medium gridâ€”demonstrating how Approximate Q-Learning overcomes the scalability limitations of traditional Q-learning.
